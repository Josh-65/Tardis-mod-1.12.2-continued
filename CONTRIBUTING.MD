# Contributing Assets and Models
To contribute models and assets to the mod, you can simply offer them to us at our discord (https://discord.gg/wdhbhTt) in the #user-creations channel
This does NOT guarantee that they will be used, it simply means we can see them and may ask you if it's okay to use them 

# "Where can I submit my super duper uber cool interior?"
- Save as above, if we ask you for it, it must be saved in vanillas NBT format 
Before you start going "But that only allows a small area!!!?!!"
You can use this mod (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/better-structure-block) to save larger NBT structures 

Interiors MUST be up to a reasonable standard.
